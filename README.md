# 👋 Hi, I’m Luis 

I build **practical systems** on the web — not demos, not toys.

My work focuses on:
- ⚙️ Automation with **n8n**
- 🤖 AI agents for real businesses
- 🌐 Static websites & landing pages
- 🐳 Docker-based infrastructure (self-hosted & VPS)
- 🧠 Clean documentation and repeatable setups

I like things that are:
- Simple
- Maintainable
- Easy to explain
- Hard to break
